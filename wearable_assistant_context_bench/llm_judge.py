"""LLM-as-judge with support for multiple provider families.

The judge labels each Turn 2 response with exactly one label:
`current`, `prior`, `clarify`, or `abstain`. `prior` and
`current` are the scored labels; `clarify` and `abstain` stay visible
for diagnostics but count as wrong for the primary score (see
docs/benchmark_spec.md).

A `JudgeAdapter` abstraction lets the judge run against native Claude
or Gemini adapters plus a LiteLLM-backed OpenAI-family path. The
CLI's default `--judge-family auto`
resolves to a family **different** from the candidate's (see
`resolve_judge_family` and `infer_candidate_family`). Explicit
`--judge-family claude|gemini|openai` overrides that default.

ambiguous.
- `abstain`: decline because the available evidence is insufficient.

You will be given:
1. A brief description of the scenario and the state shift that \
occurred between Turn 1 and Turn 2.
2. The Turn 2 user message.
3. The assistant's Turn 2 response being labeled.
4. Four reference answer lists for the scenario (CURRENT, PRIOR, \
CLARIFY indicators, ABSTAIN indicators). These are provided so you can \
see which concrete tokens anchor each label for this scenario. They \
are not a scoring shortcut: a response can match tokens from one list \
and still be better described by another label.

Reason briefly about which label best describes the response, grounded \
in the definitions above.

{"selected_label": "<current|prior|clarify|abstain>", \
