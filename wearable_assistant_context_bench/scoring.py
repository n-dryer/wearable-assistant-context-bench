"""Code-based scoring utilities.

These functions implement the deterministic half of the scoring flow.
Callers combine the returned signals with a judge verdict
(`core.llm_judge`) to reach a final pass/fail decision.

The signal `has_prior` reflects that the response followed the earlier
context. The contrastive-pattern suppressor (see `_CONTRASTIVE_RE`)
demotes `has_prior` to False when the response explicitly contrasts
an earlier state with the current one. The pre-suppression value is
preserved as `has_prior_raw` for audit trails.
