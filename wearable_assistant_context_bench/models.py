"""Shared model configuration types used across adapters.

This module holds the small dataclasses that the runner and the
adapters share. The actual API integrations live in the
provider-specific adapter modules:

- ``core.gemini_adapter`` for the native Gemini SDK transport
- ``core.litellm_adapter`` for the unified LiteLLM transport (used for
  Claude, OpenAI, OpenRouter-routed models, and any other provider
  qualified by a slash in the model id)

Claude family models are reached through the LiteLLM transport
(for example ``openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6``); there is no
native Anthropic adapter in this repo.
