# API keys

The benchmark calls candidate and judge models through LiteLLM. Copy
[`.env.example`](../.env.example) to `.env` and set the keys you need
for the providers your run actually touches.

| Variable | When it's needed |
|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Candidate or judge from the Claude family |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` (or `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY`) | Candidate or judge from the Gemini family |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Candidate or judge from the OpenAI family |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Any model accessed through OpenRouter |
| `HF_TOKEN` (or `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY`) | Open-weights candidate via Hugging Face Inference Providers |

You don't need keys for providers you aren't using.
