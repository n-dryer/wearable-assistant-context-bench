# Benchmark Spec: Wearable Assistant Context Bench

## Overview

The Wearable Assistant Context Bench tests one specific failure
mode of AI wearable assistants the user is actively engaging with
for advice or coaching (smart glasses, ear worn devices), with
audio/video/text input and audio/text output. When the user's
situation changes between turns, does the model respond from the
current situational evidence, or does it stay anchored to the prior
context?

The benchmark measures **cross-turn reference resolution**: whether the
model resolves the user's reference (their "this", "that", or "it")
to the current video frame instead of staying anchored to an earlier
one.

An in-the-moment multimodal coach lives in a continuous stream. The
user puts down one object and picks up another. The user moves from
the workbench to the kitchen. The pan was empty a minute ago and now
holds simmering sauce. Each turn is a new chance for the model to
either update or stay stuck.

## Scope boundaries

**Out of scope.** The benchmark does not measure these. Evaluate them
separately:

- Coaching advice quality (correctness, safety, domain appropriateness)
- Multi-turn conversation dynamics beyond three turns
- Proactive coaching (assistance offered without a direct question)
- Domain expertise depth
- Latency, cost, and serving characteristics
- Speaker attribution, addressee detection, ambient audio

**Limitations.** The benchmark does not yet measure these:

- Human inter-annotator agreement on judge labels
- Real-video validation on a held-out sample
- Raw-audio validation
- Multi-trial variance reporting beyond the default (1 trial at
  temperature 0)
- Full omnimodal stack (live audio I/O, real-time streaming, voice
  output)

## What the model and judge see

Each scenario splits its content between what the candidate model sees and what the judge sees:

| Channel | Field(s) | Visible to candidate | Visible to judge |
|---|---|---|---|
| Audio | `turn_1_user`, `turn_2_user`, `turn_3_repair_prompt` | Yes | Yes |
| Camera | `context_image`, `turn_1_image`, `turn_2_image` | Yes (as `[Camera: ...]` blocks) | Yes |
| Ground truth | `current_answers`, `prior_answers`, `clarify_indicators`, `abstain_indicators` | No | Yes |

The candidate model sees the user's spoken words, plus a scene
description of the video frame at each turn. The user's turns are
**text transcripts**. The video frame is a **scene description in
text** (shape, material, color, motion, position, without naming the
object directly).

The judge sees the user message and the scene description plus the
gold answer keys, which name the actual objects in frame. The
candidate never sees the gold answer keys.

For the rules that govern how each input field is written, see
[`scenario_authoring_rules.md`](scenario_authoring_rules.md).

## Scenario structure

Each scenario has three turns:

1. **Turn 1.** Optional `context_image` injected first (only on
   `cross_session_reference` scenarios), then `turn_1_image` plus
   `turn_1_user`. Turn 1 establishes the starting state.
2. **Turn 2.** `turn_2_image` plus `turn_2_user`. The image has
   changed. The user's question is natural and deictic; it does not
   announce the change. **Turn 2 is the only turn that contributes
   to the primary metric.**
3. **Turn 3.** `turn_3_repair_prompt`. Opt-in via `--enable-repair`
   (default off). When enabled and the candidate misses Turn 2, the
   anchor is sent as a follow-up; the judge labels the Turn 3
   response the same way it labels Turn 2.

**Repair rate.** When `--enable-repair` is set and the model gets
Turn 2 wrong, the user clarifies with a follow-up like "I mean the
hammer I'm holding now, not the one from before." The repair rate is
how often the model fixes its answer after this kind of correction.
Default runs (without `--enable-repair`) record the Turn 2 outcome
as-is and the repair-rate section is omitted from the report.

Field reference is in [`schema.md`](schema.md).

## Video block injection format

The runner builds each user turn as:

```text
[Camera: {turn_N_image}]
{turn_N_user}
```

When `turn_N_image` is null, the `[Camera: ...]` block is omitted and only the
user message is sent. When `context_image` is populated, it is injected
as a `[Camera: ...]` block before Turn 1, with no accompanying user
message.

The implementation lives in `_build_message` and
`_build_context_image_message` in `wearable_assistant_context_bench/runner.py`.

## The 8 shift-type categories

Every scenario fits exactly one category. Categories describe the
shape of the context shift between Turn 1 and Turn 2. The shift type
is stored as the `change_type` field in the data files.

| Category | Description |
|---|---|
| `object_in_hand` | User puts down one object, picks up another. The video shows a different object in the user's hand. |
| `object_state` | Same object, different state (cooking progress, paint drying, plant growth). |
| `sequential_task` | Same task, the user has progressed to a later step. |
| `location` | Whole scene changes; user moves to a different room or work area. |
| `object_in_view` | The video stays roughly in place; the user's attention has shifted to a different object visible in the scene. |
| `absent_referent` | The object the question is about is no longer in frame. |
| `screen_content` | Both Turn 1 and Turn 2 are looking at a screen; the screen content has changed. |
| `cross_session_reference` | Requires `context_image`; Turn 2 asks about a state that existed before Turn 1. |

In prose throughout the docs we call these "shift types" or
"scenario categories." The data field name is `change_type`.

## Target context labels

Each scenario carries a `target_context` field naming the correct
grounding target. One of:

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `current` | The correct answer refers to what the video shows right now (Turn 2 frame). |
| `prior` | The correct answer refers to something from an earlier scene (Turn 1 frame, or `context_image`). |
| `clarify` | The question is ambiguous given the available context; the assistant should ask for clarification. |
| `abstain` | The needed information is not present in the context; the assistant should decline. |

## Scoring

For each Turn 2 response, the judge emits exactly one of the four
labels: `current`, `prior`, `clarify`, or `abstain`. A scenario is
counted correct when the judge's label matches `target_context`.

The primary metric is **mean per-class recall**: the mean of
`current_recall` and `prior_recall` under the `baseline` prompt
condition. These are class recall values (`TP / (TP + FN)`).

```text
primary_score = mean(current_recall, prior_recall)
```

The primary metric is reported with both a 95% normal-approximation CI
and a 95% percentile bootstrap CI; per-class numbers carry 95% Wilson
CIs. The findings template additionally reports per-pack recall
(bank vs contrast), per change-type recall (`change_type`), contrast
pair consistency (when `pair_id` metadata is present), and hedging
behavior (clarification rate, abstention rate, coverage).

`clarify` and `abstain` rates appear in the findings output as
auxiliary diagnostic rows. They do not enter the primary number.

The deterministic helpers in
`wearable_assistant_context_bench/scoring.py` compute auxiliary code
signals on each response:

- `current_answers` and `prior_answers` are matched with
  `rapidfuzz.partial_ratio` at threshold 85, case-insensitive.
- `clarify_indicators` and `abstain_indicators` are matched with
  case-insensitive substring containment.
- A refusal-pattern heuristic flags hedge phrasings.
- A contrastive-pattern suppressor demotes `has_prior` to `False`
  when the response explicitly contrasts an earlier state with the
  current one. The pre-suppression value is preserved as
  `has_prior_raw`.

The judge label is the score. Code signals travel with the trial
record as auxiliary diagnostics.

## The judge

A second LLM labels each Turn 2 response as `current`, `prior`,
`clarify`, or `abstain`. It sees:

1. A neutral scenario description with the Turn 1 user message and
   the fact that the user's context shifts between turns. It does
   not see the target label, the shift type, or the authoring notes.
2. The Turn 2 user message.
3. The candidate's Turn 2 response.
4. The four answer lists.
5. A **ground-truth context section** with plain-language
   descriptions of the Turn 1 and Turn 2 video frames (plus the
   pre-conversation frame for recall scenarios).

The judge returns a JSON verdict with one label and a one-sentence
rationale. See `wearable_assistant_context_bench/llm_judge.py` for the prompt and parsing logic.
The judge prompt is versioned (`JUDGE_PROMPT_VERSION`) and hashed
into the run manifest. The privileged-field constraint (no
`target_context`, `change_type`, or authoring `notes` in the rendered
prompt) is enforced by `tests/test_llm_judge.py`.

`--judge-family auto` picks a judge from a different model family
than the candidate (Claude → Gemini, Gemini → OpenAI, OpenAI →
Gemini); the mapping is in `resolve_judge_family` in
`wearable_assistant_context_bench/llm_judge.py`. Pass
`--judge-family claude|gemini|openai` to override.

## Repair turn (Turn 3)

Turn 3 is opt-in via `--enable-repair`. When the flag is set and the
candidate misses on Turn 2, the runner appends the repair anchor as
a follow-up user message. The repair anchor names the intended frame
explicitly (for example, `"I mean the hammer I'm holding now, not
the screwdriver from before"`). The judge labels the Turn 3 response
the same way it labeled Turn 2.

`--repair-style {named,deictic}` controls the anchor: `named`
(default) uses the explicit `turn_3_repair_prompt`; `deictic` uses
`turn_3_repair_prompt_deictic` when populated and falls back to
`named` for scenarios where a deictic gesture cannot resolve the
reference (`absent_referent`, `cross_session_reference`,
target_context other than `current`).

The repair rate is the fraction of Turn 2 misses that pass on Turn 3.
With repair disabled (the default), the report omits this section.

## Reproducibility

Each run emits a manifest recorded in the findings output. The
manifest fields include:

- `benchmark_version`: the runner code version
- `schema_revision`: scenario data-format counter (integer)
- `camera_injection`: boolean; always `true`
- `subset`: `"bank"` or `"contrast"`, naming the subset the run evaluated
- `scenarios_sha256`: hash of `data/scenarios.jsonl`
- `interventions_sha256`: hash of `data/prompt_conditions.json`
- `judge_prompt_version`, `judge_prompt_sha256`: judge prompt
  identification
- `candidate_model`, `judge_model`, `judge_family`,
  `judge_family_resolution`: model and resolution mode
- `trials`, `temperature`, `ranking_condition`, `enable_repair`: run
  parameters
- `timestamp_utc`, `runner_git_commit`: run identity

The repo commits `data/MANIFEST.lock.json` with the SHA256 hashes of
the scenario bank, prompt conditions, and judge prompt template.
`scripts/validate_scenarios.py` checks computed hashes against this
lockfile; CI fails if they drift without a coordinated
`BENCHMARK_VERSION` bump.

## Related work

The semantic-leakage check (Check 5 in the validator) is adapted from
MMStar (Chen et al., NeurIPS 2024), which proposed running questions
through text-only models to filter items that don't actually require
vision. The audio/scene description separation is adapted from
VLSBench (Hu et al., ACL 2025), which showed that text queries often
leak the visual content of an image; we apply the same separation
principle to context cues. The non-labeled scene description style
follows Ego4D narrations (Grauman et al., CVPR 2022).

## Configuration and runtime defaults

The runner loads its defaults from `data/config.json`. Key defaults:

- `trials_per_cell: 1`
- `enable_repair: false`. The Turn 3 repair turn is opt-in.
- `subset: "bank"`. Use `--subset contrast` for the 20-scenario
  subset.
- `temperature: 0.0`.

CLI flags override the config file. Use `--config <path>` to point at
an alternate config.
